## Project Overview
As part of this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game, where the AI-controlled pirate must navigate a maze to find the treasure before the human player. The focus was on implementing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train the pirate agent and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### Pirate Intelligent Agent
- **Code Given:** The project provided starter code including `TreasureMaze.py` representing the environment and `GameExperience.py` storing episodes. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook (`TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`) contained starter code. [Click here to view Project 2 Template](Project_2_Template.ipynb)
  
- **Code Created:**
  - Completed the Q-Training Algorithm section in the Jupyter Notebook, implementing the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
  - Adjusted hyperparameters to optimize the exploration and exploitation trade-off.
  - Ensured adherence to industry best practices, utilizing in-line comments for readability and maintainability.

### Design Defense
I also submitted a design defense, discussing the approach taken to solve the pathfinding problem. A copy of the design defense can be found here: [A Defensive Approach to Intelligent Agents through Deep Q-Learning in the Treasure Maze](Resemius_Adam_ProjectTwo.docx)

The defense covered:
- Analyzing differences between human and machine approaches. 
- Describing steps for both human and intelligent agent in solving the maze.
- Assessing the purpose of the intelligent agent in pathfinding.
- Evaluating the use of algorithms, focusing on the implementation of Deep Q-Learning using neural networks for the game.

## Learning Connection to Computer Science
This project aligns with the broader field of computer science by applying artificial intelligence concepts to create an intelligent agent. It showcases the significance of algorithms, specifically in solving complex problems such as pathfinding in a maze. As a computer scientist, my role involves designing and implementing solutions that enhance efficiency and address real-world challenges.

## What I Learned Throughout the Project
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning and its application in developing intelligent agents. The experience of fine-tuning hyperparameters emphasized the importance of striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. The project reinforced the ethical responsibility of ensuring user security and privacy, particularly in data collection and usage.
